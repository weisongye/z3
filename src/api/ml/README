This directory is work in progress.

We are currently working on a brand new ML API.

On Windows, there are no less than four different ports of OCaml. The Z3 build 
system assumes that either the win32 or the win64 port is installed. This means
that OCaml will use `cl' as the underlying C compiler and not the cygwin or
mingw compilers. 

By default, a make target called `ocamlfind_install' is added. This installs Z3
into the ocamlfind package repository such that programs can be compiled via 
ocamlfind.
